Besides the workplace, it can also be used for general-purpose computing and for server environment use for the workplace for small, medium, and large enterprise and corporation. It also comes with tools and packages pre-installed to provided in order to make ease of use for the system and for the end-user.

It also strives to be lightweight on the computer and live installation CD/USB in order to provide a smooth out-of-box experience (OOBE) inspired by helloSystem, 4.4BSD, and Apple's Mac OS X Server
