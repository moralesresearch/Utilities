# About Sun/OS Unix
Sun/OS Unix is a desktop operating system based on helloSystem, FreeBSD, and 4.4BSD. It also includes a Server Edition for large workplaces.

Besides the workplace, it can also be used for general-purpose computing and can be also be used for gaming with the proper support from the developers.

It also strives to be lightweight on the computer and live installation CD/USB in order to provide a smooth out-of-box experience (OOBE) inspired by helloSystem, 4.4BSD, and Apple's Mac OS X

# A system that works for, not against, you

Privacy: Requires no activation, no IDs, no accounts. Does not spy on you. Blocks tracking and ads by default. Comes with peer-to-peer technology built in, e.g., for receiving Remote Assistance.

Freedom: Lets you load software without restrictions. No signatures, sandboxes, notarizations. Makes it easy to modify applications. No hardware vendor lock-in. Designed to run on machines that are no longer supported by their manufacturer with operating system updates.

Security: Built-in end-to-end encryption where possible. Has full source code available for verification.

# You are in Command

The Command key (⌘) is left to the spacebar on your keyboard. Use it to access shortcuts like ⌘C (Copy) and ⌘V (Paste).
